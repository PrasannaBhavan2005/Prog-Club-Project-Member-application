# Question 4
# What exactly smart pointer is
Smart pointers are basically like the 'delete' keyword which we use when we allocate an object/array in heap memory 
so as to destroy the object/array otherwise there will be high chances of memory leak.

Smart pointers basically ensures that programs are free of memory and resource leaks and are exception-safe.
