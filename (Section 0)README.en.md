# Question 1
So, my PORS are nothing except being a Coordinator of Maths Club. 
In even sem, Maths Club doesn’t have much work so I will be able to
fully commit to this project.

# Question 2
i) C Language: I did a course in 1st sem (CS1100) which was based on C language, 
that course pretty much laid the foundations of coding for me and my coding journey
started from that course itself.

ii) C++: I do my competitive programming based on C++ language only. I am very much 
clear with C++ and I always prefer doing my coding in C++. My concepts related to OOPS,
Stacks and some DSA are very much clear.

Iii) Git: I have some idea about Git that it is used to track changes in source code or 
any other collection of files, I have used it once or twice to upload some code, apart
from that I haven’t explored it much.

iv) Computer Networks: I haven’t tried this out

v) Linux: When I was applying for Abhiyaan Software, I had seen that most of the questions 
were based on Linux. I do remember that I explored the world of Linux at that time, but apart 
from that instance, I never used it.
