# Question 4 (After this question there is question 2 also)
# What exactly smart pointer is
Smart pointers are basically like the 'delete' keyword which we use 
when we allocate an object/array in heap memory so as to destroy the 
object/array otherwise there will be high chances of memory leak.

Smart pointers are basically advanced pointers provided by languages 
like C++ to manage the lifetime and ownership of dynamically allocated objects.
Smart pointers automate memory management to prevent issues like memory leaks 
and dangling pointers.
